# Assessing the impact of depth in a Neural Network
The datset used in this project is the MNIST digit classification datset. The goal of the project is :
* Implement a fully connected neural network with one hidden layer using PyTorch. Set the number of neurons in the hidden layer to 100. 
* Implement a deep neural network that has 10 hidden layers and each layer has 10 neurons.Then compare performance of this network with the previous net. 
* Assess the quality of the features generated by the 10 layer deep net (in item 2) in its different layers. For this, a deep net is trained first. Then features are generated from the hidden layer 5, 7 and 10 separately and used in k-nearest neighbour to classify the images and compare the performances of the features generated from layers 5, 7 and 10. The features from a layer mean the activation values of the neurons in that particular layer.
