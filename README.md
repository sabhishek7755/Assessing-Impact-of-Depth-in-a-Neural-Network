# Assessing-Impact-of-Depth-in-a-Neural-Network
•Studied the role of weights with increasing depth in a ANN using PyTorch over the MNIST Dataset • Extracted the features from hidden layers and applied k-NN on it to classify the images and compare performance • Observed an accuracy of 92.13%, 92.1% and 92.22% by using k-NN on layer 5,7 and 10 weights respectively
